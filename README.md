# 👋 Hi there, I’m Clinton Etuk, a full stack software developer and i’m interested in meeting Senior Developers to aid my Software Engineering journey.

# I’m currently learning about the basic frameworks for both front end and back end development, and i’m looking to collaborate on projects with anyone to gain more experience and build a portfolio while also working on my personal projects.

# You can reach me on netmediaenterprize@gmail.com or alternatively, through my social handles listed on my profile.



# let's code ❤️
